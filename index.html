  <h3>The Hut</h3>
  <P>The Hut is mainly focused on Mexican Cuisine. However, they do it very well! These are my top 3 dishes from there.
  </P>
  <ul>
    <li>California Fries</li>
    <li>Liberation Burrito</li>
    <li>Rice Plate</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>J's Restaurant</h3>
  <p>J's Restauant, I would say is a good mix of Filipino and Local cuisines. <br>Their service usually takes a while,
    but the food does not disappoint!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheese Burger</li>
    <li>Bulalo(Beef Bone Marrow Stew)</li>
    <li>Tocino w/Egg and Fried Rice</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sunny Side Cafe</h3>
  <p>In my opinion, this is the best Filipino Restauant in Saipan! Their service is very good, and hospitiality is on
    point!</p>
