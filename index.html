  <H2>The Hut</H2>
    <P>The Hut is mainly focused on Mexican Cuisine. However, they do it very well! These are my top 3 dishes from there.</P>
    <ul>
      <li>California Fries</li>
      <li>Liberation Burrito</li>
      <li>Rice Plate</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>J's Restaurant</h2>
  <p>J's Restauant, I would say is a good mix of Filipino and Local cuisines. <br>Their service usually takes a while, but the food does not disappoint!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cheese Burger</li>
  <li>Bulalo(Beef Bone Marrow Stew)</li>
  <li>Tocino w/Egg and Fried Rice</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Sunny Side Cafe</h2>
  <p>In my opinion, this is the best Filipino Restauant in Saipan! Their service is very good, and hospitiality is on point!</p>
